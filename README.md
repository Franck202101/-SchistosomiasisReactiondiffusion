 *** General introduction***
Schistosomiasis is classified by WHO as a neglected tropical disease. Recent research
works have shown that large-scale development projects involving massive population
displacement and water irrigation, such as the construction of dams, lakes, and the
development of agricultural areas, favour the proliferation of bilharzia. These
observations motivate us to propose a reaction-diffusion model to assess the role of
the displacements of humans, snails, cercariae, miracidia in the transmission dynamics
of Schistosomiasis. The model incorporates a general non-linear contact functions and
density-dependent parameters.  The aim is better understanding the role of spatial
interactions on the spread of Schistosomiasis, in order to propose appropriate
recommendations for the control of that silent threat. We characterise the basic
reproduction number $R_{0}$  of the model. The uniform persistence theory, the
maximum principle are used to conduct an in-depth analysis of both the homogeneous
and heterogeneous models.  Theoretical results are illustrated through numerical
simulations.
